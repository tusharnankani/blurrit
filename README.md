### Motivation

- Ever felt your privacy invaded when you are logged into WhatsApp Web when you are sharing your screen in a meet or on a projector?
- Or are there times when someone is sitting beside you and sees your WhatsApp chats or who you have been texting?
- Or are there times when you want to share a screenshot with the names hidden?

Moreover, the fact that when I went to look for a solution, found [the perfect one](https://wawplus.com) to be paid. So, why not build one for free?

<sub>Also, wanted to build <strike>an extension</strike> desparately.</sub>

<br />

### Local Setup

- Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/tusharnankani/blurrit.git` or download the zip file and unzip it.
- Extensions can be [loaded in unpacked mode](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked) by following the following steps.
- Visit `[chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions)` or `[edge://extensions](edge://extensions)` (via menu -> Tools -> Extensions).
- Enable Developer mode by ticking the checkbox.
- Click on the "Load unpacked extension." button.
- Select the locally cloned repository or the unzipped folder to unpack the extension.
- Visit [web.whatsapp.com](httlps://web.whatsapp.com); because **blurrit** is ready to use.
